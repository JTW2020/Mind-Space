Added decomposition rule for the phrase, "I am." under keyword: "i".
Includes three reassembly rules, 

reasmb: I see . Tell me what is on your mind right now .
reasmb: What lead to you feeling the way you do ?
reasmb: Right . Go on .

Edited a reassembly rule for decomposition rule "$ * my *" for keyword "my" so that it says,
"Lets discuss further why your (2) concerns you ." instead of,
"Lets discuss further why your (2) ."

Gave Eliza the ability to switch contexts. When a reassembly rule begins with the phrase "switchto"
the word after that will be the name of the file to switch to, without the .txt extension. Any remaining
words will be the output displayed to the user after the switch concludes. To test this functionality,
doctor.txt was altered, as a new keyword, "depressed", was added with a priority of 50.
The decomposition rule matches any input that has the word in it, and its only reassembly rule has it
switch to depressed.txt and output the message, "We will now talk about your depression ."
depressed.txt was also created as a near exact copy to doctor.txt,
except the reassembly rule for the depressed keyword simply tells the user,
"I already know that you are depressed ." and does not trigger a context switch.
These additions can be tested by repeatedly typing, "I am depressed." into the terminal.
