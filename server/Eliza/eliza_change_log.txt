Added decomposition rule for the phrase, "I am." under keyword: "i".
Includes three reassembly rules, 

reasmb: I see . Tell me what is on your mind right now .
reasmb: What lead to you feeling the way you do ?
reasmb: Right . Go on .

Edited a reassembly rule for decomposition rule "$ * my *" for keyword "my" so that it says,
"Lets discuss further why your (2) concerns you ." instead of,
"Lets discuss further why your (2) ."
